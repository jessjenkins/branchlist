# branchlist
Playing with the github API

This is a tool for printing out a list of all the branch names across an organisation's 
repositories and which repos have a branch with that name.

```
branch1: [repo1 repo3]
branch2: [repo1 repo2 repo3]
branch3: [repo4]
...
```

This is an exercise for learning go so absolotuely no quality should be expected.

Any respectful comments gratefully received.

Thanks
Jess
